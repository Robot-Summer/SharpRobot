# Autonomous Race Robot - ENPH 253 Robot Summer Mario Competition Project
In the span of 8 weeks, our team of 4 designed, prototyped, and built a fully autonomous race robot from scratch for the annual Engineering Physics Robot Summer Competition at UBC.
This is the final working state machine code implemented for our robot. 
## Outcome
Our race robot earned first place in the annual UBC Engineering Physics Summer Robotics Competition. The event was featured on CTV and the UBC Engineering News website.
